            I was born on September 17th,2001 in Upper Marlboro Maryland.I have three siblings and they mean the world to me.
            I even have them tatted on my body.I've been playing baseball since I was 8 years old. Baseball is one of the
            things that I love doing. Baseball has been a passion for me since the first time I picked up a baseball and my
            skills have sky rocketed since.

              I started using computers when I got to High School. I was in the Science and Tech program at my high school. I
              enjoy using the Adobe apps for than coding because I like designing things more than coding them. I am more
              on the artistic side of things. Adobe Photoshop is one of my favotite things to use because I love editing
              photos and making them look better.It always puts a smile on peoples faces when you show the tehir photos after
              they are edited. That is honeslty the best part.
