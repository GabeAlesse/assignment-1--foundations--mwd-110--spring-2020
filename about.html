  <p1> elmo is a little red muppet that loves to talk, one of his most famous songs "elmos world" have gained popularity amongst school children
  and college kids, perhaps you wonder why college kids but to me the answer is that we finally get to embrace our childhood again before we step into
  the adult world and leave everything behind so let us have this little bit left. </p>
  <p2> our little critter has a high pitched squeaky voice that is annoying to some (me) and pleasing to others, but hey i would never hate on elmo
  because "na-na-na-na na-na-na-na elmo's world (crying)" elmo is a wonderful little critter that to some people may seem cute but to me, creepy
  i mean think about a talking muppet, and what if cookie monster ran out of cookies? </p>
