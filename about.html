   <h1>My Goals</h1>
   <p>My biggest goal this semester for me would be improving my grades. I struggled a lot my first year, and my GPA reflected that. Coming to the university as an undecided student was definitely a challenge. Some days I could not even find the motivation to leave my bed. I ended my freshmen year of college extremely discouraged with my performance, and disappointed more than anything. The difference between this semester and now is how much I do care about school. I realize higher education is a privilige, and being a first generation student, I want to make both my family and myself proud. Since this semester began, I really enjoy my schedule and my classes. I have not had any issues with attendence, and I feel confident finally.</p>
   <p>A goal I have for myself this year would be practicing healthier habits. This past month I challenged myself to not eat meat, and I've done so with very little effort. I would definitely consider myself an animal rights activist, and eating meat does not reflect my love for them. (My favorite animal is a sloth!) The first step in my process of going vegetarian was education. My misconceptions about vegetarianism was that the diet would be unenjoyable or impossible. Upon research, I discovered the correlation between eating red meat and its environmental effects, which really persuaded me to stop. Caring for the environment is something else I am passionate about, and giving up meat is one way to combat global warming.</p>
