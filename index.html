      <header><h1>Introduction</h1></header>
      <p>My name is Brianna Weling (Bri), and I am a sophomore at the University of Hartford. Currently, I am undecided, but I plan on declaring as a digital media and journalism major by the end of the semester. I'm from north Jersey- 30 minutes away from the city, and an hour away from the Jersey Shore. Some of my hobbies include watching true crime documentaries on Netflix, going to the beach, and playing tennis. I am a huge animal lover, and I have six Shih Tzus. A fun fact about me is that I work as a party host at Rockin' Jump Trampoline Park.</p>
